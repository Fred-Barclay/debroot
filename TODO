# TODO/FIXME
#
# FIXME: BUG: the dpkg query call to generate manifest is not working.
# IMPROV: create functions to read and to save to files and use them in "Read" and "Write" buttons.
# IMPROV: debian packaging.
# IMPROV:GUI: make some sense: toggle off debootstrap and "prepare live iso" if "unsqhash" is clicked; if "debootstrap" is clicked toggle off "unsquash" and enable "prepare iso". "prepare iso" should only be available if ROOTFS-binary directory exists.
# IMPROV: GUI: add a "Browse chroot" button in "Build" tab and run "xdg-open $dir" to browse/change files in $dir. Only available if $dir exists.
# IMPROV: GUI: add a "Browse binary" button in "Build" tab and run "xdg-open $dir-binary" to browse/change files in $dir-binary. Only available if $dir-binary exists.
# IMPROV: GUI: in update tab add a button to clean apt. Add same button in Install tab.
# IMPROV: GUI: add a checkbox to "bind mount" host /dev in chroot button, as a workaround for upgrades/dist-upgrades that fail without /dev (derivatives break some policies). Maybe add that to "Upgrade" tab too.
# IMPROV: GUI: in install tab add a button to choose a script/hook to do automated stuff.
# IMPROV: GUI: sources.list help should be in a textbox, copy/pastable.
# IMPROV: GUI: run x apps from chroot with or without xnest: <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BasicChroot> or <https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:X86/Chroot_Guide#Running_X_apps_inside_the_chroot>.
# FIXME: only happens with sudo; does not with gksudo:
#Object::connect: No such signal QLineEdit::textChanged()
#Object::connect:  (sender name:   'lineEditISOPath')
# IMPROV: build USB img.
# IMPROV: support UEFI.
# IMPROV: upgrade livecd button: unsquash; remove casper from chroot to update initramfs; run dist-upgrade to update kernel; update vmlinuz and initrd.lz; reinstall casper in chroot.
# IMPROV: build a livecd with this program to create livecd of installed systems to another disk, like clonezilla/systemrescuecd/gparted.
# FIXME: see <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/resolvconf/+bug/1279760>. It happens if one doesnt install network-manager in live image.
# FIXME: xterm (no copy/paste?)
