This app started while exploring perl and QT. It started as an app that could create and run chroots. When this was reached, the potentialities of perl QT made me want go further and from the chroot I wanted to make a Live iso image and usb images. As the doors were opening I added support for Ubuntu and Debian and made the app create a bash script (instead of keeping build logs) that can rebuild the whole process without the use of this app.

ATM the app does the following:

* selects and unsqhashes an Debian or Ubuntu Live iso file (content of chroot may be upgraded, see bellow) and can rebuild it (without UEFI support for now);
* chroot APT sources.list can be edited, "apt-get update/upgrade/dist-upgrade" are a button click away;
* packages can be installed in the chroot by dropping their names in a textbox and clicking "Install";
* can create a bare minbase debootstrap of Ubuntu or Debian, and from that, create a very small Live ISO, or else one can add new repositories, install packages and then build the Live iso image.

# Bugs

See TODO file.

* To enable "Unsquash" button you may have to type and remove text in the "ROOTFS Directory" text input;
* some buttons are disabled because they are not implemeted yet.

# ROADMAP

* debian packaging;
* build non-live USB image;
* add a custom script based installer to "replace" both ubiquity or debian-installer;
* support UEFI boot.
